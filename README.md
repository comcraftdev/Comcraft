### Other
The Commit e71872501d 'Fixed ALL [Warnings] by eclipse's quick-fix tool' deleted a large chunk of code because it was obsolete/not used but I am keeping track of queader upstream, so if any unused code becomes functional i'll change this accordingly.  
I may implement some of these discarded methods in some of my commits, I will try to clearly mark and code by Queader I removed and readded.
